# Quick Setup Guide - AI Interview Prep App

## Step-by-Step Setup (5-10 minutes)

### 1. Configure MongoDB (Required)

**Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended - Free)**
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "Build a Database" â†’ Choose "Free" (M0)
4. Select a cloud provider and region
5. Click "Create"
6. Create a database user:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: (generate or create a strong password)
   - Save credentials!
7. In "Network Access" â†’ Add IP Address â†’ Allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
8. Click "Connect" on your cluster
9. Choose "Connect your application"
10. Copy the connection string (looks like: `mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`)
11. Replace `<password>` with your actual password

**Update backend/.env:**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:yourpassword@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/interview-prep?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### 2. Configure AWS S3 (Required for file upload)

**Option A: AWS S3 (Recommended)**
1. Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to S3 service
3. Click "Create bucket"
   - Bucket name: `interview-prep-docs-yourname` (must be globally unique)
   - Region: `us-east-1` (or your preferred region)
   - Uncheck "Block all public access" (we'll use signed URLs)
   - Create bucket
4. Create IAM user for S3 access:
   - Go to IAM service
   - Users â†’ Add users
   - Username: `interview-app-s3`
   - Access type: "Programmatic access"
   - Permissions: Attach "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy
   - Create user
   - **Save Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**

**Update backend/.env:**
```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=interview-prep-docs-yourname
```

**Option B: Cloudinary (Alternative - Easier)**
If you prefer Cloudinary over S3, you'll need to modify the backend code:
1. Sign up at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Get your credentials from the dashboard
3. Update backend code to use Cloudinary SDK instead of S3

### 3. Verify API Key (Already Configured)

The OpenAI API key is already set in your `.env`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-mega-b56817eee9a537f54a4e772d00919d38b38989808a8df55d11d157fdc6247aad
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://ai.megallm.io/v1
```

### 4. Start the Application

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
You should see: `Server running on port 5000` and `MongoDB connected`

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
You should see: `Local: http://localhost:3000`

### 5. Test the Application

1. Open browser: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. Create an account:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: test123
4. Upload two PDF files (one resume, one job description)
5. Click "Start Interview"
6. Answer questions and get AI feedback!

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "MongoDB connection failed"
**Solution:**
- Check your MongoDB URI is correct
- Verify your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas Network Access
- Make sure password doesn't have special characters (or URL encode them)

### Issue: "File upload failed"
**Solution:**
- Verify AWS credentials are correct
- Check S3 bucket name matches
- Ensure IAM user has S3 permissions
- Check bucket exists and is in the correct region

### Issue: "OpenAI API error"
**Solution:**
- Verify API key is correct
- Check MegaLLM endpoint is accessible
- Test with a simple request: `curl https://ai.megallm.io/v1/models`

### Issue: Frontend can't connect to backend
**Solution:**
- Ensure backend is running on port 5000
- Check no other service is using port 5000
- Verify CORS settings in backend

### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Mac/Linux
lsof -i :5000
kill -9 <PID>
```
